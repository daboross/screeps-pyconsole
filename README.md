screeps-pyconsole
=================

Extremely simple python 3 [screeps](https://screeps.com) game console.

Uses asyncio and GNU readline (through the python readline builtin) to create a console interface. Requires Python version 3.4.4+.

This project does not support much, but it should provide a solid, easily modifyable base.

To setup, copy `console.default.json` to `console.json`, add in credentials, and run the `./run` shell script.
